# Cognito Forms UX/UI Exercise

## Step 1: Design Prototype
Your first task will be to design the interface for a web quiz for middle schoolers. The interface should prompt the user with a series of multiple-choice questions (see `questions.js`), one at a time, then provide a summary of how the user answered the questions.

## Step 2: Code
The final task of this exercise is to convert your design into a functioning interface using web technologies. You can use any libraries or frameworks you like.
Technical requirements:
-	The layout must look good on large and small screens.
-	The quiz must be as accessible to the target audience as possible.
- You don't need to worry about obfuscating correct answers.

Build your quiz using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) or import it there when youâ€™re finished.

_You may edit and organize the existing files as you see fit._

---
On the following application form, provide a URL to your design (E.g., PDF link, Figma link) and a link to your functioning CodeSandbox link.
